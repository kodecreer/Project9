<h1>Project 9</h1>
This is a program that is inspired by the Salty Spitoon from Spongebob. Specifically the scene that the security guard asks people who want to come in about how tough they are. If you admit to not being tough, the guy writes your words in a file so he can remember you for next time. If there isn’t a file, he lets you know he failed to find a file on you so he asks you about how tough you are. It reads the file input and outputs it to the console. You then tell him how tough you are. If you tell a lie or something that you must admit to being tough, then you get sent to weenie hut junior’s like the episode and he writes you down for next time. If you are tough, then he writes down a file on you so he can save you time the next time you try to enter. 
You don’t need the text file, it will create one for you. If you don’t type anything he will be speechless for words as it’s like talking to someone without knowing what to talk about. So type something. The limitations though is that I only allocated 90 bits for the final words if you get sent to weenie hut junior’s. You also only have 1024 bits to testify as he has a line of people to get to and doesn’t have time for your life story. Also if you don’t type ‘y’, he will assume that means no. Since the instructions weren't clear of what to submit, I submitted the who git repo. This does require io.h to work for the system call codes.
